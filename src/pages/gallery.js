            <h2 className="sub-title">Brief History of 2D Sprites</h2>
            <p>
                2D sprites have played a significant role in the history of
                Pokémon, as they were the primary graphical representation of
                Pokémon in the early games. Here's a brief history of 2D sprites
                in Pokémon: <br />
                <br />
                Generation I (1996-1998): The Pokémon series began with Pokémon
                Red and Green (Blue in the international release) for the Game
                Boy. These games featured simple, pixelated 2D sprites for the
                151 original Pokémon. Each Pokémon had front and back sprites,
                and these designs were iconic for many fans.
                <br />
                <br />
                Generation II (1999-2000): Pokémon Gold and Silver continued to
                use 2D sprites on the Game Boy Color. The number of Pokémon
                increased to 251, and the graphics became more detailed. Gender
                differences were introduced, and some Pokémon had animated
                sprites.
                <br />
                <br />
                Generation III (2002-2006): Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, along
                with FireRed and LeafGreen, introduced 386 Pokémon. The sprites
                took advantage of the Game Boy Advance's improved capabilities,
                allowing for more colors and better animations. Pokémon contests
                and double battles added further complexity to the sprites.
                <br />
                <br />
                Generation IV (2006-2010): Pokémon Diamond and Pearl for the
                Nintendo DS featured 493 Pokémon with even more detailed sprites
                and animations. Some Pokémon also had unique animations when
                they entered battle. These games also introduced the concept of
                alternate forms for some Pokémon.
                <br />
                <br />
                Generation V (2010-2013): Pokémon Black and White took advantage
                of the DS's hardware to create dynamic and animated sprites for
                the 156 new Pokémon introduced in these games. The Unova
                region's 2D sprites received praise for their quality.
                <br />
                <br />
                Generation VI (2013-2016): Pokémon X and Y for the Nintendo 3DS
                marked a transition to 3D models for the first time in the main
                series. While not 2D sprites, it's worth mentioning here as it
                was a significant departure from the traditional sprite-based
                design.
                <br />
                <br />
                2D sprites continue to be used in various Pokémon spin-off
                games, such as Pokémon Mystery Dungeon and various mobile apps.
                They also make appearances in the Pokémon games through elements
                like the "PokeDex" and other menu interfaces. While the main
                series games have moved to 3D models, 2D sprites remain a
                beloved part of Pokémon's history and continue to be used in
                various forms in the broader Pokémon franchise.
